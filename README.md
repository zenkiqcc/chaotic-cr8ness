# chaotic-cr8ness
Rust implementation of MeterFeeder (C++ FTDI MED USB QRNG driver) + entropy streaming/API server.

## What is it?
A Rust driver and library to interface with QRNG devices. And to serve up their randomness in a high functioning server.

### The Naming
Chaotic Crateness. Origins in [MeterFeeder](https://github.com/vfp2/MeterFeeder).
* _Chaotic_ - alluding to the nature of quantum entropy/randomness
* _Cr8_ - alluding to Rust Crates
* _"Greatness"_ - in serving (feeding) said entropy to any consumers needing it
